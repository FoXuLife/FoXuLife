ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nikita, I am 22 years old. I am a novice programmer who is slowly but surely moving towards his big goal. 
I've been in programming for a couple of years, if you count conscious college education, and during that time I managed to try a couple of web development directions, but stopped at Forntend.

ðŸŽ“Proficient: HTML5, CSS3 , SASS, JavaScript, React, Redux, PHP, Yii2, Git, Figma.

ðŸš¶A short story about my path and future plans:
The path started from college, where the emphasis was placed on PHP, or rather on its Yii2 framework, from there was the first acquaintance with MVÐ¡, SQL queries, Cookies, sessions, etc.
In practice from college, I was invited to my first job in the profession, where I tightened my knowledge in Js by studying PlayCanvas, unfortunately I worked there for only 5 months and left because of my studies. 
After graduation, I was taken to the army, from which I returned in the summer of 2022.
 Now I am studying React and working with HTML/CSS(Sass), I do everything on my own and in practice, because I believe that only trial and error can achieve the goal.
